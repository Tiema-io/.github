### 🛠 What is Tiema?
Tiema is a **Domain-Specific Soft-PLC** and **Industrial Edge Gateway** designed for the 2026 era. It bridges the gap between the physical world (Hardware) and the digital world (WMS/ERP/AI).

### ✨ Core Features
- **Process Isolation (Stability First):** Every plugin runs in its own process. If one fails, the engine stays alive.
- **Protocol-Driven (gRPC over IPC):** Unified communication via high-performance gRPC (Named Pipes / Unix Sockets).
- **Single Path Architecture:** No difference between "internal" and "external" plugins.
- **Unified Robot Plane:** A standard way to control Robot Arms, AGVs, and AMRs.
- **C# Developer Experience:** Build, debug, and deploy industrial plugins using your favorite .NET tools.

### 🏗 Architecture
- **Tiema.Engine:** The master supervisor and data backplane.
- **Tiema.PluginHost:** The ultra-light worker process for plugin execution.
- **Tiema.Plugin.Sdk:** The lightweight contract for global developers.

### 💰 Join the Ecosystem
Tiema is more than an engine; it's a **Marketplace**. Developers can build, share, and monetize their industrial plugins on our global platform.
